R codes for data analysis

Here are some of the R codes that I have written as a part of my course to process data.
They include simple functions for:
1. Non-parametric tests 
2. Data analysis and data visualization that ultimately lead to model building using linear and logistic regression.

The corresponding data files for each code are included.
